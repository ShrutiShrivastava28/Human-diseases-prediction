# Human-diseases-prediction
Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast human diseases based on symptoms. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, the goal is to reduce diagnosis time and improve treatment efficiency.

Features:
Symptom-based Prediction: The model utilizes a dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases to predict the likelihood of a disease based on reported symptoms.
Machine Learning Techniques: Various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks are employed to train the predictive model.
Efficiency Metrics: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the predictive model.
Integration with ChatGPT: Assistance from ChatGPT is utilized to enhance the project development process, providing insights and suggestions for improving the predictive model.

Usage:
Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. Ensure data cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed.
Model Training: Train the predictive model using suitable machine learning techniques. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in disease prediction.

Requirements:
Python 
Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)
Dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases
